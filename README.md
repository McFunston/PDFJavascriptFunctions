# PDFJavascriptFunctions
A collection of Javascript functions for manipulating PDF files in Acrobat 

Most of these aren't intended to work very well on their own. This is simply intended as a library of usefull functions that can be incorporated into larger projects.

My folder structure may(almost certainly will) change. I'm trying to categorize the functions based on the types of things that they do.

File Modifying Functions - This is where I'm planning to put functions that actually modify the files that they are run on, either by adding content or changing the page boxes.

Preflight Functions - Functions that inspect the validity of the file for certain printing operations. For example, checking to see if all of the pages are the same size.

Support Functions - Functions that have no stand alone usefullness. getInchesSize for example converts a page box size to inches. This could be usefull for use in a lot of different functions but not by itself.
